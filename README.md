Project: This project goal is to teach an artificially intelligent software how to diagnose heart rhythms and identify their anatomic
locations from an ECG recording
* Idea:

1. *User Uploads 12 ECG Images*: The process begins with the user uploading 12 Electrocardiogram (ECG) images through a web interface. This is typically facilitated by a form on a webpage where users can select and submit their ECG images for analysis.

2. *Server Receives and Stores Images*: Once uploaded, the images are sent to the backend server where they are temporarily stored for processing. This involves receiving the image data and saving it in a way that it can be accessed for the next steps in the process.

3. *Image Preprocessing and Data Normalization*: Before the images can be analyzed, they undergo preprocessing and normalization. This step is crucial for preparing the images for consistent and accurate analysis. Preprocessing may include tasks like resizing images, adjusting contrast, or cropping to focus on relevant parts of the ECG. Normalization ensures that the pixel values of the images are scaled to a standard range, which is important for machine learning models to perform effectively.

4. *Machine Learning Model Processes Images*: The preprocessed and normalized images are then fed into a machine learning model. This model has been trained to analyze ECG images and make predictions about the health outcomes they indicate. The model examines each image, extracting and interpreting complex patterns and features that are indicative of specific health conditions or outcomes.

5. *Prediction Result Sent Back to User Interface*: After the machine learning model has analyzed the images and arrived at a prediction, this result is sent back to the web interface. This involves packaging the prediction in a format that can be easily understood and displayed to the user.

6. *User Views Prediction Result*: Finally, the user can view the prediction result on the web interface. This might be presented in the form of a text summary, a graphical representation, or any other format that effectively communicates the findings of the analysis.


Tech: Integrating Python into a Node.js application
    reason: Python and Node.js each have their areas of strength. Python is renowned for its simplicity and readability, as well as its powerful libraries in areas such as data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch). Node.js, on the other hand, is highly efficient for building fast, scalable network applications and real-time systems. By combining them, you can utilize the strengths of both ecosystems in a single application. For projects that require heavy scientific computing or machine learning components, Python's libraries are often more advanced and numerous than those available in JavaScript. Integrating Python allows developers to implement complex algorithms and models within a Node.js application, enabling sophisticated data processing and analysis capabilities.
